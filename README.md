# CSL7510 Asignment1 Q2

Docker application deployment

Note: Per response by Instructor to a question on GC, using a base OS image is allowed. Everything else would be installed from scratch.

As in Q1, the same Phonebook Application would be used and containerized for this part of the assignment. Starting from a base ubuntu 22.04 image, nginx, php and mysql would be setup and deployed.
